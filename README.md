## üìù Project Overview
This project provides a **data-driven movie rental analytics solution**. It focuses on analyzing **customer rental behavior, movie preferences, and store performance** to derive actionable insights for improving business strategy. The project leverages SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI to extract, analyze, visualize, and interpret movie rental data for decision-making.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement
The movie rental business faced challenges such as:  

- Limited visibility into customer segments and rental behavior.  
- Difficulty identifying top-performing and underperforming movies.  
- Lack of insights into store-wise and regional rental trends.  
- Reactive decision-making in marketing, inventory, and promotions.  

This project addresses these issues by creating a structured approach to **analyze, visualize, and interpret rental data**, enabling data-driven strategies for growth.

## üõ† Problem-Solving Approach

### Data Collection & Organization
- SQL scripts (`SQL_Movie_Analytics.sql`) to query and extract data from the movie rental database.  
- Dataset stored in `data/` folder for easy access and reproducibility.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Excel file (`EDA_Movie_Analytics.xlsx`) for detailed trend analysis, outlier detection, and rental patterns.  

### MECE Analysis
- Structured MECE insights (`MECE_Movie_Analytics.docx`) ensuring comprehensive and non-overlapping findings.  

### Dashboards & Visualization
- Interactive Power BI dashboards (`Dashboard_Movie_Analytics.pbix` and `Movie_Analytics.pbix`) to visualize KPIs, customer segments, movie popularity, and store performance.  

### Presentation & Reporting
- PowerPoint presentation (`Movie_Analytics.pptx`) summarizing insights, findings, and actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
